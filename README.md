# EVM Rust Emulator

The EVM Rust Emulator is a simple in-memory Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) emulator written in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for developers who want to test EVM bytecode execution directly in a command line or in a Rust crate, without using a full EVM node with his RPC to interact with a blockchain.

  ## Install crate

  ```

  ## Usage
  ```rust
  use evm_rs_emulator::Runner;

  fn main() {
    let caller = [
      0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
      0x00, 0x00, 0xc4, 0x11, 0xe8,
    ];
    let origin: Option<[u8; 20]> = None;
    let address: Option<[u8; 20]> = None;
    let value: Option<[u8; 32]> = None;
    let data: Option<Vec<u8>> = None;
    let bytecode: Vec<u8> = vec![0x60, 0xff, 0x60, 0xff];
    
    // Create a new interpreter
    let mut runner =
        Runner::new(caller, origin, address, value, data, None);

    // Run all the bytecode
    let _ = interpreter.interpret(bytecode, Some(255), true);

    // Or run the bytecode OPCODE by OPCODE
    runner.bytecode = bytecode;
    runner.debug_level = Some(255);
    // Run the first 3 opcodes
    let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
    let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
    let _ = runner.interpret_op_code(runner.bytecode[runner.pc]);
  }
  ```
